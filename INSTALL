INSTALL
---------------------------------------------------------------

Installation should be done using one of the following methods
(in order of preference);

1 - binary via operating system installer (ie RPM)
2 - source via operating system installer (ie RPM)
3 - source via 'tar-ball'
4 - source via sourceforge repository

NOTE: Building from source will require a complete development 
environment. 

Binary via RPM
--------------

RPM is a popular software package managment system for Linux. It
is used by; SuSE, RedHat and others. This install method is the
easiest and safest. Some operating systems use a similar method
to RPM. See the documentation for your operating system for 
details. 

Source via RPM
--------------

The source RPM (SRPM) can be installed. The sources can then be
built in the usual way. SRPM's on SuSE (for example) will 
usually get installed into /usr/src/packages/SOURCES and will 
simply produce a source 'tar-ball'. See "Source via 'tar-ball'"
for more.

Source via 'tar-ball'
---------------------

The source 'tar-ball' can be built in the usual way. Unpackage
the files using;

tar zxvf unixODBC-GUI-Qt-<version>.tar.gz

Now follow the instructions in README.build file.

Source via SourceForge Repository
---------------------------------

See README.svn
