Description:

	External documentation.
	See About.txt.
	
Collection:
	
	This documentation is a collection of Qt Assistant
	documentation projects.

        The documentation consists of HTML files which are 
	described by a project file (Project.qhp). The 
	documentation is 'compiled' into a Qt Assistant
	readable binary file (Project.qch).

        The collection is described by CollectionQ4.qhcp. The 
        entire collection is compiled with the following 
        command;

	$ qcollectiongenerator CollectionQ4.qhcp -o CollectionQ4.qhc

        The documentation can be viewed with the following command;

	$ assistant -collectionFile CollectionQ4.qhc

	It is expected that the documentation will usually be 
        viewed via the applications Help options.
