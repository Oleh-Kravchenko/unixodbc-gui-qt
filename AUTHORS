such - some or all of the authors of unixODBC may have had a

for ODBCTestQ4 where it was Nick Gorham. ODBCTestQ4 was heavily 
modified, by Peter Harvey, upon creation of this project. See the 
main unixODBC project for a list of authors.

The following is a list of folks who have since contributed to 
the unixODBC-GUI-Qt project.
