 * \class   CDataSourceNames
 * 
 * \brief   Widget to allow Data Source Names (DSN's) to be managed.
 *
 *          This is used to support \sa CManageDataSourceNames by implementing
 *          the bulk of the features in a way which is useful for a specific scope.
 *          This widget can be instantiated with ODBC_USER_DSN to support managing
 *          User DSN's or with ODBC_SYSTEM_DSN to support managing System DSN's.
 * 
 *          Basically; this widget wraps some buttons around a CDataSourceNames so that
 *          the DSN's can be; Added, Edited, or Removed.
 *
 * \note    Do NOT try to use this to manage ODBC_BOTH_DSN. See \sa CManageDataSourceNames
 *          for that.
