README
---------------------------------------------------------------

Description:

	This is a program which allows menu driven execution of 
	ODBC calls. This program also allows 'auto tests' to be
	executed. 

	This program has been created to provide similar 
	functionality as the MS odbctst32.exe program.

Authors:

	This program was created by Nick Gorham and then heavily
	modified by Peter Harvey during a pure Qt4 port. Some
	features may not be ported at this time.
